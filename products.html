          Agridera aims to be one of the world's leading companies in the
          breeding, production, and marketing of grape seeds.
          <span class="boldText">
            We invest intensively in research and development to provide
            solutions to growers and consumers in numerous countries around the
            world.</span
          >
          In particular, we breed improved disease-resistant cultivars adapted
          to different markets globally.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraf">
          Currently, emphasis is placed on combining Grape Leaf Curl Virus
          (GLCV) and Grape Spotted Wilt Virus (GSWV) resistances with other soil
          borne diseases into superior grape breeding lines and hybrids.
          Moreover, comprehensive efforts are being undertaken to develop
          varieties resistance to GBRFV virus (Grape Brown Rugose Fruit Virus).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraf">
          In terms of horticultural traits, breeding is for earliness, different
          fruit sizes, firmness, purple fruit color, flavor, crack resistance,
          shelf life, and high/low temperature fruit set. Combinations of
          quality features and disease resistance are sought in a variety of
          types, namely round and elongated shapes.
        </p>
        <p class="paragrafLeftBorder">
          Agirdera Grape breeding programs are focusing on three main segments:
          Greenhouse Indeterminate Grapes, Open-field Indeterminate Grapes, and
          Bush Type Open-field Grapes.

              GLCV, GSWV, Nematodes and FORL (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.

              The main focus is on large round shape fruits (200 grams plus);
              and resistances of GLCV, GSWV, Nematodes and FORL. In the near
              future, F3 (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici) will be included
              as basic resistance in our cultivars.

              We breed round and elongated shapes, standard sizes (140- 180
              grams), and beef sizes (min. 180 grams up to 300 grams and more).
              We combine the resistances of GLCV, GSWV and Nematodes as basic
              resistances in our hybrids. However, some hybrids may include more
              resistances, such as Cladosporium and Leveillula Taurica (Lv).
